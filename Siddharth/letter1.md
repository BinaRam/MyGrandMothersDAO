I am delighted to know you; thanks to your Dad for the introduction.

Congratulations on completing the Coursera Blockchain Specialization. For a high-schooler, it is indeed an outstanding achievement. More important, I am glad that you are as passionate about blockchain as I am.

I am glad that you have launched an NFT, on Ropsten. That is always good to go with testnet, before you venture into mainnet. I will check it out.
Try Infura too next time!

The new year is always an exciting time, probably for many. One feels good to start new projects based on last year’s accomplishments. I set my goals in three; I am planning on three products around blockchain, a Coursera specialization on DeFi, a blockchain and crypto book (I have already signed on), and research Bitcoin Taproot signatures scheme to address Tx time. Siddharth, I can involve you in all these projects or specific projects based on your interest and time availability. I know how busy you must be with your school and extracurricular activity. I have mentored many, including my children, when they were teens.

If there is any advice I give my students and mentees, it is to read **and read a lot**. (and Write too!) Whatever subject that interests you. I read a lot to improve my imagination and creativity (and to discover blockchain applications). For example, I recently read the book **Ready Player One**, a futuristic fiction. I feel that **smart contracts** can code many tasks in that book’s plot! Mind you, this book was written well before the advent of blockchain. This book also mentions Metaverse. I am also looking into the Metaverse – blockchain relationship.

I am so glad that you reached out to me; we’ll keep in touch. We will work on impactful projects of mutual interest to both and expand our knowledge and experience about blockchain.
