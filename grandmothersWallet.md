My grandmother's wallet.

When I was growing up in India as a little girl, I spent my summers at my grandparent's.  Our parents packed us off during summers to our grandparents' living in another city. That was our "summer camp" for my siblings and me. Reflecting on those days, they were terrific learning experiences. I am sure many of you have your own stories about **your summers at grandma's**. Here is one.

My grandmother carried her daily spending money (rupees and paise) in a knot at the corner piece of her dress, the #saree. See the picture. That was her #wallet, safe and secure, always with her. When she went to a market to buy produce, say for x = 70 paise, she unknotted her "wallet," gathered and took out coins totaling y (= paise coin 50+ paise coin 25), usually more (y > x) than the amount to be paid for the product, and let the vendor keep the change as the Tx tip. She was indeed very generous. Hmm... this sounds like the #Bitcoin UTXO model! Even my fifth-grade-educated grandmother knew how to **manage a wallet**!
