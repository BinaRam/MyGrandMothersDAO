My grandmother's wallet.

When I was growing up in India as a little girl, I spent my summers at my grandparent's.  Our parents packed us off during summer to our grandparents' living in another city. That was our "summer camp" for my siblings and me. Reflecting on those days, those were terrific learning experiences. I am sure many of you have your own stories about your summers at grandma's.


She carried her daily spending money (rupees and paises) in a knot at the corner piece of her dress, the #saree. See the picture. That was her #wallet, safe and secure, always with her. When she went to a market to buy produce, say for x = 75 paise, she unknotted her "wallet," gathered and took out coins totaling y, usually more (y > x) than the amount to be paid for the product, and let the vendor keep the change as the Tx tip. Hmm... it sounds like the #Bitcoin UTXO model! Even my grandmother knew the UTXO model and how to manage a wallet!
