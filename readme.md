# My Grand Mothers DAO

Long ago, I used to spend time at my grandmother's place: She knew basic math and some writing and reading in the local language. But she knew how to manage money. And she was the organizer of a "chit" fund. A group of ladies (say, 10) joined in the "chit" fund group. Each of them will pay a subscription of X amount of rupees per month. The number of members determines the term of the chit, in this case, ten months. Every month 10X - y is available for anyone as funds for their use. Some form of auction or voting determines who gets the (**liquidity**) pool and the y. The amount y is distributed among the members. On it repeats every month until the term of the "chit." DAO is not new. Even an illiterate grandmother knew how to do it!
