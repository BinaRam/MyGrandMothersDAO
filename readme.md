# My Grand Mothers DAO

Long ago I was at my granddmother's place: Her education was upto 5th grade. 
She knew basic math and some writing and reading in the local language. But she knew how to manage momey.
She was the organizer of a "chit" fund. 
A group of ladies (say, 10) joined in the "chit" fund group. Each of them will pay a subscription of X amount of rupees per month.
The duration of 10 month was decided on the number of members. Every month 10X - y is available for anyone as funds for their use.
The amount y is decided by some form auction or voting. On it repeats every month until the term of the "chit". 
DAO is not new. Even illiterate grandmother know how to do it!
