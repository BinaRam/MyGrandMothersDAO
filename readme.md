# My Grand Mothers DAO

Long ago, I used to spend time at my grandmother's place: She knew very little math and some basic writing and reading in the local language. But she knew how to manage money. And she was the organizer of a "chit" fund. A group of ladies (say, 10) joined in the decentralized "chit" fund group. Each of them will pay a subscription of X amount to collect a (**liquidity pool**) of 10X. The number of members determines the term of the chit, in this case, ten months. Every month, 10X - y is available for anyone as funds for their use. Some form of auction or voting determines who gets the pool and the discount "y." The amount y is distributed among the members. On it repeats every month until the term of the "chit." 
Even the fifth-grade-educated grandmother from the pre-computer generation knew how to do liquidity pools (LP) and DAO.
