# My Grand Mothers DAO

Long ago, I used to spend time at my grandmother's place: Her education was up to 5th grade. She knew basic math and some writing and reading in the local language. But she knew how to manage money. She was the organizer of a "chit" fund. A group of ladies (say, 10) joined in the "chit" fund group. Each of them will pay a subscription of X amount of rupees per month. The number of members determines the term of the chit as ten months. Every month 10X - y is available for anyone as funds for their use. Some form of auction or voting determines the amount y. On it repeats every month until the term of the "chit." DAO is not new. Even illiterate grandmothers know how to do it!
